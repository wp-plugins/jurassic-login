Login error message inspired by the 1993 Steven Spielberg film Jurassic Park.

== Description ==

A fan of the 1993 film Jurassic Park?
Remember the scene where the park security gates fail? Ray Arnold (Samuel L Jackson) is attempting to get it all back online and working only to be greeted with a message from Denis Nerby (Wayne Knight) saying he 'didn't say the magic word'.
Don't remember it? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfiQYRn7fBg" target="_blank">Watch it here</a>.

Well now you can, to a degree, recreate this on your own WP login screen for anyone who enters incorrect login details.

When someone enters incorrect login details the usual WP login error will appear with an additional animated GIF.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `Jurassic Login` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Visit the WP admin login page and enter incorrect login details

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this plugin be maintained? =

To be honest probably not. If I can find some clean audio I may add that but unless I get any requests for features/alterations this plugin will not be updated.
I will however keep testing it with the latest versions on WordPress.
